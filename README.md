# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System

A **content-based movie recommendation system** that suggests movies similar to a user-selected title by analyzing movie metadata such as genres and overview descriptions. This project uses natural language processing techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find and recommend the top 5 most similar movies.

## üß† Concepts Used

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommending movies similar to a selected movie based on their attributes (genres, overview).
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning and combining movie metadata for analysis.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converting text into numerical vectors that reflect the importance of words.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Measuring the similarity between movie vectors to find close matches.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Extracting meaningful features from movie descriptions.


## ‚ú® Features

- Recommends movies based on content similarity rather than user ratings.
- Uses both genres and movie overview text for more accurate recommendations.
- Handles missing data gracefully.
- Provides top 5 similar movie recommendations.
- Interactive dropdown for movie selection.
